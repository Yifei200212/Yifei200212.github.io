Since entering university, I have gradually developed a passion for badminton. The thrill of making quick reflexes and split-second decisions in the game captivates me.

However, the school's facilities are limited, making it difficult to get court time during the semester, so I usually indulge in it during the summer break.üòÅ

## Traveling

China is vast and diverse, with each city boasting its unique culture and atmosphere. I love exploring different places, experiencing their beautiful scenery, and indulging in local delicacies.

## Piano

I enjoy playing the piano during my free time, both popular and classical music. By the time I graduated from high school, I had achieved Grade 8 from the Royal Academy of Music.
